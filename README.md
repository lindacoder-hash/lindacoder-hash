# Welcome to My GitHub 👋  

Hi there! I'm Oluchi Orji, a software engineer  passionate about building scalable, high-performance applications that can handle massive requests while optimizing cloud costs. I've had the opportunity to work with a fast-paced startup, where I honed my skills in:  

🚀 **Handling Large Requests** – Designing systems that efficiently process high-throughput traffic.  

⚡ **Building Scalable Applications** – Ensuring compute resources dynamically scale up or down based on demand.  

☁ **Cross-Cloud Migrations** – Seamlessly migrating workloads between multiple cloud providers.  

🖥 **On-Prem & Hybrid Deployments** – Deploying and managing scalable applications in on-prem environments, including setting up secure server-to-server (S2S) communication.  

💰 **Cloud Cost Optimization** – Monitoring and reducing compute, storage, and data transfer costs without sacrificing performance.  

Feel free to check out my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
